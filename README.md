# Sticky notes

## Description:
- The goal of this project is to create a preformant draggable hook in react.
- The hook should turn a element draggable.
- It should be reusable, should not cause unnecessary rerenders, etc.
- The hook should not store element position a state as position change will force lots of unnecessary rerenders.
- It should utilize requestAnimationFrame to render element before next paint.
- It should not attach unnecessary event handlers to elements and leave them be, it leads to issues when multiple elements use this hook.
